# Call Centre

These data were retrieved as monthly zip files from http://ie.technion.ac.il/serveng/callcenterdata/index.html and then aggregated into a single CSV file.

This data set describes data recorded at the telephone call-center of a bank in Israel. The data were organized by Ilan Guedj, who was at the time a graduate student of the Faculty of
Industrial Engineering and Management at the Technion, Haifa.

The Internet site http://ie.technion.ac.il/~serveng contains a lot of material that is based on analysis of these present data.
